	<h1>About the BIG Little Science Centre Society (BLSCS)</h1>
	<p>BIG Little Science Centre (BLSC) was started in February 2000 by Gordon R. Gore, a retired science teacher who has dedicated his life to teaching science in an interactive environment. The centre currently operates out of four classrooms and gym leased from School District 73 at Happyvale School. The current program format allows visitors a period of time to experiment on their own at any of 140 plus hands-on stations located in the gym. The four other rooms are used for shows, demonstrations, and as basic teaching laboratories.</p>

	<p>The BIG Little Science Centre Society (BLSCS) was established in October 2002 and registered as a charitable organization in September 2003. The Society has a leadership of volunteer directors who meet monthly. The current Volunteer Board represents a diverse range of experience and skills including education, accounting, engineering, business, science and the trades. Many dedicated volunteers help to run the science centre, donating over 2000 hours per year of service. If you wish to volunteer please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.
